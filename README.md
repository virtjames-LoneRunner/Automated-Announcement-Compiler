# Automated-Announcement-Compiler
This is an automated compiler that listens for messages from various group chats in messenger and sends them through SMS and a dedicated group chat.

I made this to automatically collect important announcements from our instructors that each have their own group chats. This is also able to notify those who lack the access to a stable internet connection by automatically sending them the announcements through SMS.
